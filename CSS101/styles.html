    <h1>BLOCK ELEMENT !!!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>A BLOCK level element, by default, takes up ALL the space to
            the right and to the left, internal to its parent
        </li>
        <li>A BLOCK CAN have height and width</li>
        <li>NOTHING can ever be on either side (internal to the parent) because
            it's 100%. 
            <li>If you change the width, it will just add margin.
            Blocks will ignore margin you add, because they're already 100%</li>
        </li>
        <li>Can be > 100%</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="block-wrapper">
        <div id="block1" class="block">Gmail</div>
        <div id="block2" class="block">Images</div>
        <div id="block3" class="block">Settings</div>
    </div>

    <h1>INLINE elements!</h1>
    <ol>
    1. Respect left and right padding, left and right margin
    but will ignore top and bottom
    2. Couldn't care less what is left or right. 
    3. With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline
    element how big to be.
    4. Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so 
    </ol>

		<h1>Inline block</h1>
		1. Can have stuff on either side (inline positive)
		2. Can have height/width (block positive)
		3. Can have top/bottom padding/margin (block positive)
